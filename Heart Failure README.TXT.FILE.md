
# Heart Failure Prediction & Model Comparison 🫀

This project focuses on predicting patient survival (Heart Failure) by comparing various Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms. The goal is to find the most precise model for clinical predictions.

## 📋 Project Overview
Using clinical data, this project analyzes factors contributing to heart failure and implements multiple classification models to determine the best-performing one based on precision and accuracy.

## 🛠 Models Implemented
I have compared the following models in this project:
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Random Forest Classifier**
- **XGBoost Classifier**
- **Artificial Neural Network (ANN/FNN)**

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handled scaling and train-test splitting.
- **Model Comparison:** Evaluated each model using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score.
- **Library Stack:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, TensorFlow, Tabulate.

## 📈 Results
The project concludes by comparing all models in a tabular format. In this specific run:
- **Best Model:** ANN (FNN) was identified as the 'Precision Machine' for mortality prediction.
